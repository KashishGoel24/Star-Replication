Server design 

1. To keep track of mapping from key to value we still maintain a dictionary
2. Each key is mapped to a tuple of int and (int or None) which is the request id and the version number respectively
3. version state remains the same mapping a key to either dirty or clean state
4. right now there is self.next and self.prev but later we will change this
