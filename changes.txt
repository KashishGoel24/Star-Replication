Server design 

1. To keep track of mapping from key to value we still maintain a dictionary from str to str
2. Each key is mapped to a tuple of request id and the verison number and hence (str, Optional[int])
3. version state remains the same mapping a key to either dirty or clean state
4. right now there is self.next and self.prev but later we will change this
5. we will define a queue for every server where we put the set requests we get and process them one by one
    a. we will have to put each and every request in the queue and cant serve the read requests immediately as it may hurt linearizability
    b. so when we get any request we will put the request into the queue and there will be a single thread serving the requests which will fetch the requests and serve them
